Only three or four of the 22 species are reasonably well-known. Baird\'s beaked whales and Cuvier\'s beaked whales were subject to commercial exploitation, off the coast of Japan, while the northern bottlenose whale was extensively hunted in the northern part of the North Atlantic late in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</string>
